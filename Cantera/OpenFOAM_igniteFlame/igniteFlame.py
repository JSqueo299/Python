# Script used to import VTK data from OpenFOAM to Python/Cantera to ignite the flame. Use foamToVTK in OpenFOAM to convert data to VTK. Script reads in data from OpenFOAM, then solves a diffusion flame at equilibrium for all cells in the mesh, which is saved into a csv file.
# Download pyvista at the following link: https://pswpswpsw.github.io/posts/2018/09/blog-post-modify-vtk-openfoam/
